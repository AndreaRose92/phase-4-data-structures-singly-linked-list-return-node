#  Singly Linked List Return Node Lab

## Learning Goals

- Build a `Singly Linked List` and use it to solve an algorithm

## Introduction

Now that we have learned to build out our `Singly Linked List` and `Node` classes, as well as implement the methods we might need to use them, let's use our `Singly Linked List` to solve an algorithm!

Fork and clone this lab; you'll be coding in the `lib` folder. You can
run the tests at any point using `learn test` to check your work.

## Instructions

Given a Linked List and a number n, write a function that returns the value at the `n`â€™th node from the end of the Linked List. If the `n`'th node does not exist, return null.
